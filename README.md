# 🎧 Ground-Truth-Free SER Human Evaluation

This repository hosts the **human evaluation interface** for the research project [**Ground-Truth-Free SER**](https://github.com/arozcan/ground-truth-free-ser), which aims to assess emotional expressiveness and naturalness in **synthetic speech** generated by various Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems.

## 🔍 Overview

The application allows human raters to:
- Listen to speech samples synthesized by multiple Generative AI TTS models.
- Evaluate **how effectively each target emotion is conveyed**.
- Rate **how natural** each sample sounds on a 7-point scale.

All ratings are collected anonymously and securely stored for research purposes.

## ✨ Features
- 🎧 Integrated audio player for each sample  
- 🔢 Dual-rating system (emotion effectiveness & naturalness)  
- 🧠 Automatic session management (resumes from last rated sample)  
- 🔐 Password-based rater login with XML-based user configuration  
- 💾 Progress autosaving to CSV files per user  
- 🧱 Streamlit-based responsive web UI

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arozcan/ground-truth-free-ser-human-eval.git
cd ground-truth-free-ser-human-eval
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Run the App
